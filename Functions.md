### Crash Javascript documentation

##### `_require`

Asynchronous `require` override;
it allows to load modules both
from `<usr>/lib/node_modules/<module-name>`
and LHS' canonical `<usr>/lib/<module-name>`.

To use this function, the library must be loaded with `import`
rather than with `require` and the module in which
it's used must have `sourceType: "module"` key-value
in its `package.json`.

```javascript
const
  _libcrash_module =
    await import(
      "crash-js");
const
  _libcrash =
    _libcrash_module.default;
const
  _require =
    _libcrash_module._require;
```

##### `_source`:
    See [`require`](
           Functions.md#_require)
